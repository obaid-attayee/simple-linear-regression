# simple-linear-regression
This project is meant to provide an overview of simple linear regression, how the model is computed, and how certain metrics are calculated and their significance. The regression model is built in 2 different ways: 1) by manually calculating the the regression and metrics, and 2) by using the scikit-learn library. 

The dataset used is from Kaggle @ https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression.
Description of dataset: "The training dataset is a CSV file with 700 data pairs (x,y). The x-values are numbers between 0 and 100. The corresponding y-values have been generated using the Excel function NORMINV(RAND(), x, 3). Consequently, the best estimate for y should be x."
